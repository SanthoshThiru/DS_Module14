# DS_Module14: APPLICATIONS OF QUEUE

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various applications and types of the Queue data structure, primarily in C.

## Experiments

Each experiment details a specific queue concept or application, including code and documentation.

* **Ex6: Circular Queue**
    * Implementation and operations of a circular queue.
    * *Files:* `Ex6-Circular-queue.md`, `circular_queue.png`

* **Ex7: Priority Queue**
    * Demonstrates the functionality and usage of a priority queue.
    * *Files:* `Ex7-Priority-Queue.md`, `priority_queue.png`

* **Ex8: Dequeue**
    * Exploration of Double-Ended Queues (Dequeue) and its operations.
    * *Files:* `Ex8-Dequeue.md`, `dequeue.png`

* **Ex9: Applications of Queue - SJF**
    * Illustrates queue application in Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling.
    * *Files:* `Ex9-Applications of Queue - SJF.md`, `app_of_queue.png` (assuming this or `app_of_queue_FCFS.png` applies here)

* **Ex10: Applications of Queue - FCFS**
    * Presents queue application in First Come, First Served (FCFS) scheduling.
    * *Files:* `Ex10 Applications of Queue FCFS.md`, `app_of_queue_FCFS.png`
